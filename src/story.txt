Bengoma and Bengomi, the talking birds were gossiping.
They were talking about the kingdom of Indrapur.
Once there was kingdom of Indrapur.
There lived a king who had two queens.
Suorani and Duorani.
Suorani had a son named Nilkomol,
and Duorani had one son named Lalkomol.
Suorani was a virtuous woman who always wished good for king and the people of Indrapur.
While Duorani always conspired against Suorani as her son was the heir to the throne.
One day Duorani called his step-son, Nilkomol.
She told him, "There lies Gajendra forest at the edge of the kingdom. A monster remains there guarding a sacred 
treasure. You must bring it back to bless our kingdom."
"Her name is Shakchunni, she is a vicious creature.
She will attack any who passes by her territory."
And so, brave Nilkomol went in search of the sacred relic
which will bless his kingdom."
