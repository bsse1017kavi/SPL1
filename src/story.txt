Once there was kingdom of Indrapur.
There lived a king who had two queens.
Suorani and Duorani.
Suorani had a son named Nilkomol,
and Duorani had one son named Lalkomol.
Suorani was a virtuous woman who always wished good for king and the people of Indrapur.
While Duorani always conspired against Suorani as her son was the heir to the throne.
